<h2>potential irrigation area</h2>

<div class="container">Agriculture is the main source of the world food production. It covers 70 to 85% of the food
    supply. In the case of Africa agriculture with rainfall is not sufficient for food production
    because of prevalence of different factors that negatively affect growth. Environmental
    situation, deforestation and soil degradation are serious problems for development of rain-fed
    agriculture in the world especially in Africa </div><br>

<div class="child"> Irrigated area per capital is declining
    due to enlargement of population growth. Beside this the availability of water resources may
    not be able to meet various demands in the near future, but the inevitably more area to be
    brought under irrigation in order to achieve a sustainable global food security for the increasing
    population. These results will decline of land potential for irrigation by affecting the land
    suitability and reducing the water availability.</div>
